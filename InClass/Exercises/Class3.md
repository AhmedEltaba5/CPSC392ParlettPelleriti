1. Load the pandas library, and alias it so you can use `pd` instead of typing `pandas` each time you need to access the package.

2. Load the iris and wine datasets. Store them in `iris` and `titanic` respectively.

`iris_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv'
titanic_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv'
print("done")`

3. Print the head (first 5 or 6 rows) of each data set.

4. Store the sex column from the titanic dataset in the variable `four`. Print it.

5. Store the 10th row from the iris dataset in the variable `five`. Print it.

6. Grab the age of the 12th person in fthe titanic dataset and store it in the variable `six`. Print it.

7. Store the mean age of titanic passengers in the variable `seven`, print it.
