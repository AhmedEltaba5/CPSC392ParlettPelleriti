1. How is the conditional probability P(vegetarian | dog owner) different from the regular probability P(vegetarian)?
*The conditional probability only looks at dog owners (| dog owner means "if we know someone is a dog owner"). The regular probability looks at all people, dog owners or not.*

2. Probabilities can only be between 0 and 1, like the probability of getting heads in a coin toss. If we took the odds of getting a heads (p(heads)/p(tails)) what range of values can the odds take?
*Odds can range from 0 to infinity. Plug in a few numbers for yourself. What if p(heads) = 0.0000001, what about 0.1, 0.5, 0.999, 0.9999?*

3. You have data from a survey. One of the questions asks students to pick one of the following responses: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree. What data type applies here, what are your justifications for that decision?

*The data for this question are categorical, and the categories are ordered so it is an ordinal variable. You can debate whether the scale is also interval (the distance between each subsequent item is equal), but it is at least ordinal.*
